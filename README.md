# Form validation custom hook for react
  The aim is to provide a toolkit for realtime validation of frontend forms, using custom hook and validator npm package. 
## Features
  Upon providing the input components the props provided by the custom hook, the component will provide a real time feedback about the state of each input value's validity. 
  The validation rules come from a scheme that must be provided for each input group. Each scheme must contain each validation rule for each input field.
